/*! \mainpage Welcome to the Human Supervised Multi-Robot Systems (HSMRS) Framework!
*
*\section intro Introduction
*This framework was created in order to establish a structured approach to implementing multi-robot systems which take input from and produce output for a human supervisor. The framework was implemented as a test to evaluate its effectiveness. The implementation was done using ROS, and the hsmrs_framework package contains many implementation files which can serve as examples for future implementations.
*
*\section requirements Requirements to implement
*In order to use this framework, the developer must do the following things: 
* - Implement the robot class for their specific robot. The turtlebot_node.cpp file can be used as an example.
* - Create extensions of the Task class to represent all of the tasks the robots in the system can perform.
* - Write code for the robots that will allow them to carry out their tasks.
* - Evaluate the attributes and parameters of the robots to build into their utility functions.
* - Create a GUI that will allow the user to supervise their robots. For a generalized GUI the hsmrs_gui can be used.
*
*The presented steps are very high level and will require more work than immediately apparent to complete. They are also the bare minimum requirements to make the system work.
